# BroBalance

## Project Idea

BroBalance is a student-focused money management application designed to help students track money they lend to friends.

Students frequently lend small amounts for food, travel, events, and shared expenses, but often forget who owes them and how much. BroBalance provides a simple and intuitive platform to track, manage, and remind friends about pending repayments.
